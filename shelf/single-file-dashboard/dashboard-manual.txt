HYDERC DASHBOARD MANUAL

IMPORTANT NOTE

As this is alpha stage software there may be bugs,
and usage is at your own risk. You should always keep
backups using Git version control or similar.

A version allowing for community editing by creating
a public static HTML dashboard is planned, this would
then link to files on GitHub for collaboration.
Though, this idea may instead be handled in a separate
package included as a dashboard.blade.php file,
using the default layout.


SECURITY

This is not a traditional CMS like WordPress and similar.
It's never supposed to be on production systems.
Instead, it's a local developer tool.
Think of it as an integrated development environment
specifically tailored for use with HydePHP projects.

As the dashboard modifies files on the computer running it
and gives arbitrary access to the server by running shell
commands, opening files, and executing programs, it is
extremely important that the dashboard is not exposed
to the internet. You must only ever use this dashboard
as a local development tool.

A basic check is made to block requests not made from
localhost as an extra precaution. You should still
never make the dashboard.php file publicly accessible.

Also note that error reporting is enabled by default,
as the dashboard assumes that all who can access it
are authorized to use the system running it.

The app is not safe against XSS/script injection either
as not all output is sanitized or escaped; and the
output that is escaped, is only made so to prevent
visual glitches, like displaying source HTML tags.
